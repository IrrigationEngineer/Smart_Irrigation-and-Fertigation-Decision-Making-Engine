## Smart Irrigation and Fertigation Decision-Making Engine
Smart Irrigation and Fertigation Decision-Making Engine, Here we would try to introduce some smart irrigation and to know how it work.
I will summarize this article here. The list of articles in the series is as follows:

### Overview 

Here is a review of the Smart Irrigation and Fertigation Decision-Making Engine. It mainly gives you an introduction to what is SIFDE and its engine content.

### Introduction  

Here is a general introduction to the introduction of the function of SIFDE, and its still existing possible and its impact.

### Crop Growth Model

The importance of the crop growth model in the SIFDE is stated, and what are the specific influencing parameters of the crop growth model?

### Soil Moisture Model

The importance of soil moisture in the SIFDE is unquestionable. Here is a brief introduction to the application of soil moisture model in decision-making.

### Crop Nutrient Model 

The nutrients of crops are their nutrients, that is, water-soluble fertilizers here. Water-soluble fertilizers are important components of crop nutrition. Here we mainly introduce the interaction between most used fertilizers and their role in promoting of crop yields.

### Parameter Calibration Method

Whether it is a mathematical model of growing, the soil moisture and nutrients, there are problems of correction of input parameters. Here we focus on the basis, process and characteristics of parameter calibration and adjustment.

### Image Analysis

How to obtain crop growth period and nutrient physiological information, crop height, LAI value and biomass and other indicators through field images, and the image analysis module of SIFDE realizes (1) identification of crop physiological growth period. (2) Obtaining NDVI based on image from remote sensing, can eliminate instrument calibration, enhance the ability to respond to vegetation, and calculate the NDVI statistical characteristics of different objects to calculate the real-time LAI value of crops. (3) Field images have important application prospects for the evaluation of crop diseases and insect pests, yield estimation, agricultural product quality and quality inspection, and crop straw resource utilization.

### Leaf Growth Parameter Calibration

The focus of the calibration of leaf growth parameters is its leaf index LAI value. It is explained here that the adjustment of relevant parameters is adjusted according to the leaf index obtained by image analysis.

### Assimilate distribution ratio calibration

The distribution of assimilates in different crop organs is important in the digital model of crop growth. First, it determines leaf quality, and thus leaf area index and light interception; second, it determines the distribution of products (grain, roots, etc.), as well as yield levels and harvest indices.

### Development Approach

The decision engine introduces cutting edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) including machine learning, image recognition and expert systems to analyze the input parameters of the mathematical model of the crop, automatically correct the appropriate parameters, and realize the digital accurate simulation of the crop growth process. 

### Conclusion

The Smart Irrigation and Fertigation Decision-Making Engine successfully uses the crop digital model, the nutrient expert system, and the SIFDE system to elevate smart agriculture to a higher level. The mathematical model of crop growth realizes precise irrigation and fertilization through the growth values of each stage of crop growth period, reduces fertilizer consumption, reduces water waste, and brings tangible benefits to users.
